This Python script visualizes UK sensor position data by processing a CSV file with latitude, longitude, and sensor type information. Using pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib.pyplot for visualisation, it filters data to include only UK-bound sensors and overlays their locations on a UK map. The script handles errors like missing files, empty datasets, or incorrect formats, ensuring robust performance. The resulting scatter plot is clean and user-friendly, making it an effective tool for spatial data analysis.
